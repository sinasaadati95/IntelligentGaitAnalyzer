#Local Computing (Agent-based Modeling and Simulation)

In this project, the concept of the Boots algorithm is developed and evaluated. The results demonstrate that the Boots algorithm can meticulously and reliably compute the biomechanical, neural, and physiological details within the human body during gait. Detailed biomechanical, neurological, and physiological information can be found within the project. The project is developed in Java, following the principles of object-oriented programming, which is essential for agent-driven modeling and simulation.
