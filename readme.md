# Intelligent Gait Project

In this project, an intelligent, fully cloud-based, and IoT-based methodology that digitizes human motion signals is presented. Using reverse engineering,  the neurophysiological interactions of the human body are simulated to analyze motion details meticulously. Finally, artificial neural networks detect whether the motion is normal or abnormal for each lower body joint. 

## Projeect Structure 

### 1.LocalComputing (Agent-based Modeling and Simulation)

In the "LocalComputing" directory, you can find our simulation programming projects focused on the physiological and biomechanical aspects of gait. Developed in Java, these projects can be executed on local computers and are available as open-source. 

### 2. On The Cloud (Fully Cloud and IoT-based Application)

The "OnTheCloud" directory contains our main application, which can be maintained on the cloud and executed by any computer connected to the Internet. This directory includes the graphical user interface, simulations, and other necessary modules, all published as open-source. 

### 3. Artificial Neural Networks (Deep Learning Framework)

In the "ArtificialNeuralNetwork" directory, an interpretable deep learning-based methodology is presented that analyzes motion signals captured by our IoT-based method to detect abnormalities in lower body joints. These projects, developed in Python, can be executed on both local computers and cloud-based servers.
